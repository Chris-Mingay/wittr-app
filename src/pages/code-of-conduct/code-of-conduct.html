            filling. No one wants to hear you crunch,
            chew or masticate in any way. Nachos

            flagon of pop, you really don't need the
            melting ice too. You are not six years old.

            <span class="lead">No Irresponsible Parenting</span>
            Your five-year-old does not want to come
            to see the latest 12A certificate: you are
            using the cinema as a babysitter. Your
            child's moaning, whinging and crying is
            your fault and a profound annoyance to
            everyone else. Your interrupted sleep
            caused by your child's nightmares is also
            your fault and serves you right.

            This includes knitting, drug dealing, model

            and updating Facebook.

            <span class="lead">No Talking</span>
            You’re in a cinema – you have come here
            to watch, not to discuss. Or ‘engage’, or
            ‘participate’, or ‘explain’ or whatever. More
            importantly, no-one in the cinema has paid
            £8.50 to hear your director’s commentary
            on the movie. Just sit down and shut up.

        <ion-item text-wrap>
            <span class="lead">No Mobile Phone Usage</span>
            At all. Not even on ‘flight mode’. This isn’t
            an aeroplane, it’s a cinema. Even if you’re
            not yapping, you’re still creating light
            pollution. Put your thumbs away.<br/>
            NB: includes BlackBerries, Palm Pilots,
            iPads - whatever.<br/><br/>
            NBB: this also includes using your mobile device to use this app. If you are currently in the cinema and reading this you are violating the code of conduct!

            <span class="lead">No Kicking of Seats</span>
            The area of floor directly in front of your
            seat is yours, and is there to put your legs
            in. The back of the seat in front of you
            belongs to someone else; do not touch,
            interfere with, or otherwise invade their
            space with your feet, knees, or other bodily
            appendages.

            <span class="lead">No Arriving Late</span>
            Like Woody Allen in Annie Hall, you’re
            supposed to watch movies from the very
            beginning to the very end. If you turn up
            late, tough: go see something else -
            The Sorrow and the Pity, perhaps.

            <span class="lead">No Shoe Removal</span>
            You are not in your own front room. Nor
            are you in Japan (unless you are, in which
            case, carry on). A cinema is a public space:
            keep your bodily odours to yourself.
